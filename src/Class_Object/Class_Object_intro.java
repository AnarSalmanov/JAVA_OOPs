	/**                           CLASS
      -Class is a property for methods, global variables(instance and class variables),
       constructors ,static blocks and instance blocks.
       Class is a blue print.
	  -Class is Non-Primitive, Some classes come with Java and we can create our own classes as well.
	 *

		                        OBJECTS
	   -Object created from class, we can create n number objects, each object will inject class members separately.
	   -Using object we can initialize value to variables, call methods from class etc.
       -Objects are in heap memory, they have behaviors(methods).
       -Primitives are in stack, they don't have behaviors.
  NOTE: Mostly we call instance methods fom another class and pass parameters either for void methods or return type methods.

      * If we did not pass value to class variables direct or with object or setter method,or in constructor,
        then when we call those variables, String=null, int=0, boolean=false.
      * We can see only non-static stuff with class object.

  NOTE :When we create an object of class then class turns to data type and object turns to object of it.
        We can create a methods with return type of class name as well, and to call this method with class object.
