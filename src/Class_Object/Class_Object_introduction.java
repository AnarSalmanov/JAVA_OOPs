	/**                           CLASS
      -Class is a property for methods, global variables ,constructors and static blocks . class is a blue print.
	  -Class is Non-Primitive, Some classes come with Java and we can create our own classes as well.
	 *
	      
		                        OBJECTS
	   -Object created from class, we can create n number objects, each object will inject class members separately. 
	   -Using object we can initilize value to variables, call methods from class etc.
       -Objects are in heap memory, they have behavioral(methods).
       -Primitives are in stack, they dont have behaviorals.
  NOTE: Mostly we call methods fom another class and pass parameters eather for void methods or return type methods.
 
      * If we did not pass value to class variables direct or with object or setter method,or in constructor,
      * then when we call those variables, String will be null, int =0, booleb=false.
      * We can see only non-static stuff with class object.
     
  NOTE :When we create an object of class then class turns to data type and object turns to obect of it.
        We can create a methods with return type of class name as well, and to call this method with class object.
